**TIGER SCHEDULING**


**DEVELOPED BY: JOSEPH A. LAUDATI**

**Tiger Scheduling** is an app designed to help those in need of a simple solution 
to help them keep track of their day-to-day tasks. It does so in a very user-friendly way, with a simple 
and easy-to-use interface.


It dynamically creates new "date" objects and appends them to a list. While that happens, they are paired with a reminder schedule that notifies them when their event is coming up. The "when" they'll be reminded is solely based on user input. The user can also remove any unwanted dates they may have accidentally added. However,
the list of items currently acts like a stack where the user must pop newer items from the list to remove a specific date. 

For now, this app is a tool that ensures that you are reminded!
